# deep-reinforcement-learning-optimal-pedestrian-signal-design
This study is to investigate the optimal control strategies at crosswalks using traffic signal controllers.  The proposed reinforcement learning framework is aimed to 

(1) find the optimal control policy that minimizes the number of conflicts (safety) while reducing traffic delay (efficiency), 

(2) account for different scheduling scenarios with various combinations of pedestrian flow rates and vehicle flow rates, and 

(3) make comparisons with baseline traditional traffic signal controllers and semi-controlled strategy. 

There are two baseline control strategies: fixed time control and adaptive pedestrian signal control (pedestrian click control). The following figure demonstrates the best performance of deep reinforcement learning control (smart control strategy).
