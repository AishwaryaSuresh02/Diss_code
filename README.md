# deep-reinforcement-learning-optimal-pedestrian-signal-design
There are two baseline control strategies: fixed time control and adaptive pedestrian signal control (pedestrian click control). The following figure demonstrates the best performance of deep reinforcement learning control (smart control strategy).

The base deep-Q module is credited from https://github.com/AndreaVidali/Deep-QLearning-Agent-for-Traffic-Signal-Control. We slightly revised the deep-Q-module to change the state-action representation.
